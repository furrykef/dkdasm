Sections
--------
Your MML file must have the following sections:
* SONGS: A table listing songs to play.
* PLAYLIST_A: A list of patterns to play. These songs use volume decay.
* PLAYLIST_B: Works the same as playlist A, but the songs do not use volume decay.
* PATTERN: one section per pattern.


SONGS
-----
The song table has 13 entries.

There are three possible values for a song:
* The name of an entry in playlist A
* The name of an entry in playlist B
* The name of a pattern

If you are using the name of a pattern, the pattern must be one of the first 14 patterns in the file.


PLAYLIST_A / PLAYLIST_B
-----------------------
Each playlist has up to 16 entries.


PATTERN
-------
An empty pattern named "end" is automatically generated for you.
